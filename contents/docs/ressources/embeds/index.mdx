## What is it?

Embeds allow you to send rich, styled messages using a special `{embed}` syntax.  
They support simple messages, title, description, color, images, footers, timestamps and more — perfect for announcements, logs, or onboarding.

## Getting Started

### Structure

Each parameter in the embed is represented by a key-value pair which is separated by a colon. 
For example, the title parameter will look like `{title: hello {member.mention}}`. 
The `{member.mention}` is a variable which will be filled in with the user’s mention.

- `{` - begins a parameter.

- `:` - separates parameter from content.

- `::` - separates parameters.

- `}` - ends a parameter.

### Parameters

- `title` - Set a title.

- `desc` - Set a description.

- `color` - Set a color.

- `image` - Set a image (url only).

- `thumbnail` - Set a thumnail (url or valid placeholders).

- `footer` - Set a footer.

- `author` - Set an author.

- `timestamp` - Set a timestamp in the footer for the embed (args is `yes`).

## How to create an embed ? 

Embeds can be created by 2 differents ways. Either directly in the commands which actually support the syntaxe, 
or create an embed by using the command `embed create` and use it with it name.

        <TabsTrigger value="syntax">Syntaxe</TabsTrigger>
        <TabsTrigger value="example">Exemple</TabsTrigger>
      </TabsList>
      <TabsContent value="syntax">
        ```plaintext
        $embed create <name> (args)
        ```
      </TabsContent>
      <TabsContent value="example">
        ```plaintext
        $embed create welcome {embed}::{desc: Hellow}
        ```
      </TabsContent>
    </Tabs>

<ImageWithGridBg src="/embed1.png" alt="Nebula" size={20} />

You can also add a message linked to your embed by using the key `{message:}` before the `{embed}` key.

<ImageWithGridBg src="/embed2.png" alt="Nebula" size={20} />

### Variables 

You can use dynamic variables in your embeds yo display user/server specific informations. 

```plaintext
$embed create welcome {message: Hello {member.mention}}::{embed}::{desc: > Welcome in the server. Read the rules.}
```

<ImageWithGridBg src="/embed3.png" alt="Nebula" size={20} />

This system is also used in Lastfm custom embed. 

## Update an embed

You can use the command `embed update` to update your embed. 

<Note type="info">
    If you consider using an embed in a command like `stickymessage`, `autoresponder word` or any other command supporting this feature, 
    use the command `embed create` first and assign the embed to the command. The updating part of the embed is easier this way.
    If you don't plan to change very often, you can assign the message using the syntax directly. 
</Note>

The `embed update` command work 2 ways. You can either give the name of the embed and the args (`{embed}::{key1: ...}...`) directly, 
or run `embed update` with only the name of the embed. 

<ImageWithGridBg src="/embed4.gif" alt="Nebula" size={20} />

or you can use this directly : 

```plaintext
$embed update welcome {embed}::{desc: > Welcome in the server. Read the rules.}
```

## More

To check every embed created and existing in your server, you can run the command : 

```plaintext
$embed list
```

To delete an embed after using the command `embed create`, use the command : 

```plaintext
$embed delete welcome
```

You can also clear all the embeds of the server running the command : 

```plaintext
$embed clear
```

<Note type="warning">
    This action can't be undone and all embed linked to external command won"t work anymore, and will need to ne updated.
